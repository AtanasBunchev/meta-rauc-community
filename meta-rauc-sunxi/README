Support
========
This has only been tested on two Sunxi boards (both sun8i). Specifically, the OrangePi Zero and the OrangePi Plus 2E. 

fw_printenv Issue
=================
Due to the varying storage options on the Sunxi boards, it is very likely that the fw_env.config file you use will need to change. This file is located in `meta-rauc-sunxi/recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/fw_env.config` (or on your system `/etc/fw_env.config`). If you are having issues with fwprintenv not working, this is likely the issue. Follow the following steps to identify the correct setup for your fw_env.config file:
1. Ensure your uboot.env file is present following your boot. Note: it may be on a totally different storage device than your SD card. Sometimes, it is in your /boot partition - in which case, just `ls /boot` and you should see it (If this is the case, what I am providing by default should just work provided the uboot.env file is present).
2. To search for the file elsewhere, spin up your u-boot prompt by halting the boot process when prompted. You can then `mmc list` (to see your storage options) and `ls mmc x:y` (where x is the device and y is the partition number - i.e. 1:1, 0:2, ...). Once you find it, make note of the device its on.
3. Boot into your system. Run `hexdump -C /dev/mmcblkX | grep BOOT_A_LEFT`. Once something comes up, you can kill the output. It should look like this: 

```
root@orangepi-plus-2e:~# hexdump -C /dev/mmcblk2 | grep BOOT_A_LEFT
00e92000  87 c9 96 6e 42 4f 4f 54  5f 41 5f 4c 45 46 54 3d  |...nBOOT_A_LEFT=|
```
4. Make note of the hex value at the beginning of that line. In this case its `00e92000`. Now, open up `/etc/fw_env.config` in your favorite text editor and modify you are going to change it to the following format:
first value: device
second value: environment offset (you can feel free to remove the leading zeros here as I have done).
third value: length of environment (in my testing on the two boards I have used, this value was the same for both, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility for this to require different values for different boards).
```
/dev/mmcblk2 0xe92000  0x20000
```
